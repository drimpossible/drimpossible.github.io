This is created because Disqus wanted a link, so here goes (sourced from disqus examples). 

We may have heated discussions sometimes and that’s cool. It's topics that we deeply care about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to sustain, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people. So, as a general policy, please remember to avoid:

 * name-calling
 * ad hominem attacks
 * Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
 * Knee-jerk contradiction

Comments that I find to be hateful, inflammatory, annoying or harassing will probably be removed. I do not submit myself to [Crocker's rules](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker%27s_rules) here. Please email me at bayesianconspirator at mailfence dot com for any comment or [anonymous feedback form](https://www.admonymous.co/bayesiankitten), where you may optimize your message for information, and not worry about whether your message will be offensive.
